# Mushroom Classification and Description Web App

## Overview

This project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify mushroom species using three different pre-trained modelsâ€”InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and Xception. The models achieved accuracies of 82%, 80%, and 80%, respectively. A Flask-based web application was developed to facilitate real-time predictions. The application allows users to upload mushroom images, predicts the species, and provides detailed descriptions generated by GPT-2, enhancing the user experience with informative insights.

## Features

- **Mushroom Classification**: Classify mushroom species using three CNN models.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload mushroom images for prediction.
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Automatically generate informative descriptions of predicted mushroom species using GPT-2.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web application built with Flask for easy interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Python  
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Transformers
- Other Python libraries as specified in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mushroom-prediction.git
    cd mushroom-classification-app
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download Pre-trained Models**

    Make sure you have the pre-trained models saved in the specified paths:
    - `C:\Mushroom\model\InceptionV3_Model.h5`
    - `C:\Mushroom\model\DenseNet121_Model.h5`
    - `C:\Mushroom\model\Xception_Model.h5`

## Usage

1. **Run the Flask App**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    This will start the Flask development server. By default, it runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **Access the Application**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the upload page.

3. **Upload an Image**

    Use the upload form to select and submit an image of a mushroom. The app will process the image, predict the species, and display the result along with a detailed description.
